Hi, i'm Darragh.
I started coderdojo back in 2018 so I could expand on my knowledge of HTML (web design).
With the help of the people over at coderdojo, I've finally ticked off one of my items on my bucket list: Create & host a website.
I created a website for my film and computer business, that has been going since 2011, but never had a website.
But it does now!
I created my website using the HTML language, and I decided to have my website based on a Single-Serving-Site (websites that only have on webpage to them, no hyperlinks or anything like that, and I also wanted to have my website accessible to everyone, even on phones, games consoles, tablets, and especially for those with slow connection speeds. But has expanded ever since. It was hard to understand at first, but I got there eventually. And after 3 weeks of coding out the scripts, my website was complete. Once my website was finished, I had to find a way of hosting it, and signed up to 000webhost, they offer absolutely free web hosting, (provided you coded the website yourself) forever, and no ads either! (yay) you can check out 000webhost here: https://www.000webhost.com/1125606.html
If anyone out here has an interest in computer programming, I highly reccomend Coderdojo Athlone, it allows you to mix with like-minded people, while having fun creating a digital masterpiece.
Currently, my website is updated every week, and I'm now exploring the amazing world of computer viruses (don't worry, you won't get anywhere near them)
Here is a link to my website if you are interested: https://datfilmsireland.000webhostapp.com
I hope you check out coding, and how fun it can be. I thank you for reading.
